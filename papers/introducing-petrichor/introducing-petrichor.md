Petrichor is an advanced writing app that fuels a deeper understanding of your interests. It’s designed for anyone who loves diving deep into research and making unexpected connections between ideas. By merging an intuitive editor, automated semantic linking of documents, and AI-powered assistance, Petrichor helps you stay organized and uncover new insights as you write.

Petrichor is available for free while in beta, and can be accessed at [petrichor.md](https://petrichor.md).

## The Idea Behind Petrichor

I started Petrichor as a side project in December 2025. Having used Obsidian for my personal notes, I admired its knowledge graph feature but found needing to manually link my notes and ideas tedious. I envisioned a tool that could automate this process, not just to save time, but to enhance creativity by suggesting connections I might not have considered.

I also wanted a way to *talk* to my knowledgebase — to ask questions, get feedback, and explore ideas in a more conversational manner. This led to the development of an AI assistant that could understand the context of my writing and provide relevant information and suggestions.

The result is Petrichor, a writing app that combines the best of note-taking, writing, and AI to create a seamless experience for anyone who loves to write and learn.

## Core Features

### WYSIWYG

At the core of Petrichor is its intuitive WYSIWYG editor, which allows users to format their documents easily while focusing on the content. The editor supports markdown and KaTeX, and is versatile enough for any type of writing, from academic papers to personal journals.

The editor is also designed to be distraction-free, with a clean interface that puts the focus on your writing. As you write, we automatically index your text and the resources, references, and citations you link to, creating a richer, more connected knowledge graph.

Other features include version history, sharing options, and export to various formats, making it easy to share your ideas with others and publish your work.

### Automated Semantic Linking

One of the standout features of Petrichor is automated semantic linking. As you write, Petrichor analyzes your text in real-time, and connects your thoughts to other documents and resources in a graph-based view. This not only makes it easy to see how your ideas relate to eachother, but also encourages exploration of related concepts you might have overlooked.

### Contextualized AI Agent

Petrichor is also equipped with an AI agent that is fully contextualized with your writing, and can provide tailored suggestions and feedback. Whether you're searching for relevant research papers, requesting help with brainstorming, or seeking clarification on complex topics, the AI assistant is designed to enhance your writing experience.


### Daily Insights

Petrichor provides daily insights based on your writing activity, helping you track your progress, identify trends, and discover new connections between your ideas. These insights can be used to fuel further research, spark new ideas, or simply reflect on your writing habits.

Right now, Petrichor only uses ArXiV as its primary source of interesting material for you to read. However, we are working on integrating other sources, such as YouTube, Reddit, and Twitter, to provide a more diverse range of content.
